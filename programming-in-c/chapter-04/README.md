# Chapter 4: Program Looping

## Exercise 4.1

Type in and run the nine programs presented in this chapter. Compare the output produced by each program with the output presented after each program in the text.

* [Program 4.1](exercise-01/prog4-1.c)
* [Program 4.2](exercise-01/prog4-2.c)
* [Program 4.3](exercise-01/prog4-3.c)
* [Program 4.4](exercise-01/prog4-4.c)
* [Program 4.5](exercise-01/prog4-5.c)
* [Program 4.6](exercise-01/prog4-6.c)
* [Program 4.7](exercise-01/prog4-7.c)
* [Program 4.8](exercise-01/prog4-8.c)
* [Program 4.9](exercise-01/prog4-9.c)

## Exercise 4.2

Write a program to generate and display a table of `n` and `nÂ²`, for integer values of `n` ranging from 1 to 10. Be certain to print appropriate column headings.

* [Exercise 4.2](exercise-02/exercise-02.c)

## Exercise 4.3

A triangular number can also be generated by the formula

`triangularNumber = n (n + 1) / 2`

for any integer value of `n`. For example, the 10th triangular number, 55, can be generated by substituting 10 as the value for `n` in the preceding formula. Write a program that generates a table of triangular numbers using the preceding formula. Have the program generate every fifth triangular number between 5 and 50 (that is, 5, 10, 15, ..., 50).

* [Exercise 4.3](exercise-03/exercise-03.c)

## Exercise 4.4

The factorial of an integer `n`, written `n!`, is the product of the consecutive integers `1` through `n`. For example, 5 factorial is calculated as

`5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120`

Write a program to generate and print a table of the first 10 factorials.

* [Exercise 4.4](exercise-04/exercise-04.c)

## Exercise 4.5

The following perfectly valid C program was written without much attention paid to its format. As you will observe, the program is not very readable. (And believe it or not, it is even possible to make this program significantly more unreadable!) Using the programs presented in this chapter as examples, reformat the program so that it is more readable. Then type the program into the computer and run it.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void){
int n,two_to_the_n;
printf("TABLE OF POWERS OF TWO\n\n");
printf(" n     2 to the n\n");
printf("---    --------------\n");
two_to_the_n=1;
for(n=0;n<=10;++n){
printf("%2i        %i\n",n,two_to_the_n); two_to_the_n*=2;}
return 0;}
```

The reformatted program:

## Exercise 4.6

A minus sign placed in front of a field width specification causes the field to be displayed _left-justified_. Substitute the following `printf()` statement for the corresponding statement in Program 4.2, run the program, and compare the outputs produced by both programs.

`printf ("%-2i          %i\n", n, triangularNumber);`

_* It would appear that the text meant to refer to Program 4.3 for this exercise_

## Exercise 4.7

A decimal point before the field width specification in a `printf()` statement has a special purpose. Try to determine its purpose by typing in and running the following program. Experiment by typing in different values each time you are prompted.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main (void)
{
    int dollars, cents, count;

    for ( count = 1; count <= 10; ++count ) {
        printf ("Enter dollars: ");
        scanf ("%i", &dollars);
        printf ("Enter cents: ");
        scanf ("%i", &cents);
        printf ("$%i.%.2i\n\n", dollars, cents);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

* The decimal point before the field width specification ensures that cents are correctly displayed to two places even if the user enters a single digit.

## Exercise 4.8

Program 4.5 allows the user to type in only five different numbers. Modify that program so that the user can type in the number of triangular numbers to be calculated.

* [Exercise 4.8](exericse-08/exercise-08.c)

## Exercise 4.9

Rewrite Programs 4.2 through 4.5, replacing all uses of the `for` statement with equivalent `while` statements. Run each program to verify that both versions are identical.

* [Program 4.2](exercise-09/prog4-2-while.c)
* [Program 4.3](exercise-09/prog4-3-while.c)
* [Program 4.4](exercise-09/prog4-4-while.c)
* [Program 4.5](exercise-09/prog4-5-while.c)

## Exercise 4.10

What would happen if you typed a negative number into Program 4.8? Try it and see.

* The program reverses the digits, but each nonzero digit is preceded by a minus sign.

## Exercise 4.11

Write a program that calculates the sum of the digits of an integer. For example, the sum of the digits of the number 2155 is 2 + 1 + 5 + 5 or 13. The program should accept any arbitrary integer typed in by the user.
